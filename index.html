      <h2>History of python </h2>
      

      <p>Python is a widely used general-purpose,high-level programming language. 
It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. 
It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, 
and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.</p>
<p>The two of the most used versions has to Python 2.x & 3.x. There is a lot of competition between the two and both of them seem to have quite a number of different fanbase.</p>

<p>For various purposes such as developing, scripting, generation and software testing, this language is utilized. Due to its elegance and simplicity, top technology organizations like Dropbox, Google, Quora, Mozilla, Hewlett-Packard, Qualcomm, IBM, and Cisco have implemented Python.</p>
      <p>Python has come a long way to become the most popular coding language in the world. Python has just turned 30, but it still has that unknown charm & X factor which can be clearly seen from the fact that Google users have consistently searched for Python much more than they have searched for Kim Kardashian, Donald Trump, Tom Cruise etc.</p>
      <p>Python has been an inspiration for many other coding languages such as Ruby, Cobra, Boo, CoffeeScript ECMAScript, Groovy, Swift Go, OCaml, Julia etc.</p>
